  <div>
    <h3 id="what-is-the-repository">What is the CLARIN.SI repository?</h3>
    <p>The CLARIN.SI repository is like a library for linguistic data and tools. It is provided
    by <a href="http://www.clarin.si/info/about/">CLARIN.SI</a>, the Slovenian Common Language
    Resources and Technology Infrastructure.</p>
	<p>You can use the repository to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>search for linguistic data and tools and easily download them;</li>
      <li>deposit your data or tools being sure that it is safely stored, and that everyone can
	find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
	
  <div>
    <h3 id="what-submissions-do-you-accept">What kinds of submissions does CLARIN.SI accept?</h3>
    <p>We accept any linguistic and/or NLP data and tools: corpora, treebanks, lexica, machine
      readable dictionaries etc.  We also accept trained language models, parsers, taggers, MT
      systems, etc.  CLARIN.SI repository also supports e-signature of licences for immediate
      access to restricted resources.</p>
    <p>When uploading language resources, please use one of the recommended formats mentioned
      in <a href='http://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/Standards%20for%20LRT-v6.pdf'>Language
      Resource Standards</a>.</p>
  </div>
		
  <div>
    <h3 id="do-i-need-to-create-an-account-to-download-andor-make-a-submission">Do I need to create
    an account to download and/or make a submission?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can download <strong>data and tools which have a license that allows free
	  sharing</strong> without a log-in. Please read the license prior to downloading the
	  resource. This applies to all data with one of the
	<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons
	licences</a> and to tools with <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses"
	target="_blank">open source</a> licenses.
      </li>
      <li>To download data and tools that require you to sign a license, you need to log in. To
	make a submission, you also need to log in. However, if you are affiliated with an academic
	institution you probably don't need a new account.</li>
      <li><strong>Just click &quot;Login&quot; in the upper right corner and search for your
	academic institution.</strong> To log-in, you can use any account with an Identity Provider
	that is a member of EduGAIN federation.</li>
      <li>If you don't have an academic account, you can get one
      through <a href="https://idm.clarin.eu/user/home">CLARIN ERIC</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3	id="cant-login">I see an error logging in.</h3>
    <p>Please let us know through our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>, if you
    have any trouble logging in.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, usually when you are the first one logging in using your home institution, you
    might see an error stating &quot;<strong>The authentication was successful; however, your
    identity provider did provide neither your email, eppn nor targeted id.</strong>&quot; This
    means your home institution did not send us enough data about you to operate our service; the
    institution is doing so to protect your personal data. We only require an email and we are
    following <a href="http://www.geant.net/uri/dataprotection-code-of-conduct">Data Protection
    Code of Conduct</a>, which helps us convince the institution we won't abuse data about you.</p>
    <p>If you have an account with multiple providers and you login with different one each time,
    you might see error stating &quot;<strong>Your email is already associated with a different
    user</strong>&quot;. Please try to use the same provider each time. However, if that is not
    possible, let us know and we will change your default provider.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="why-should-i-submit-my-data-into-your-repository">Why should I submit my data into
    CLARIN.SI repository?</h3>
    <p>Here are some of the reasons why submitting to CLARIN.SI repository is a good choice.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>It is free and safe.</li>
	  <li>We respect your license. We encourage Free Data and believe it benefits not only the
	    users, but also the data providers. However, we accept also more restricted data and we
	    can make users sign a license before downloading your data, if that is what you
	    need.</li>
	  <li>The data is visible, giving you maximal credit for your work, also via other
	    services, such as Google, VLO, DataCite, OLAC, Data Citation Index, and arXive.</li>
	  <li>The data is easy to cite. We provide <em>ready-to-use</em> one-click citations in
	    BibTex, RIS, and other popular reference formats. All the citations include permanent
	    links created from persistent identifiers (we use handles for PIDs).  These PIDs are
	    future-proof.</li>
	  <li>For some data types (in particular, text corpora), we can provide additional
	  services, like a concordance search.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="why-should-i-submit-my-tools">Why should I submit my tools into CLARIN.SI repository?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See &quot;<a href="#why-should-i-submit-my-data-into-your-repository">Why should I submit
	my data into CLARIN.SI repository?</a>&quot;.  Everything applies to software tools
	too.</li>
      <li>You can just link your version control system (svn, git), if it is publicly
	accessible. You can also link your project page, or demo site.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="common-search-tool">Is there any common search tool across different CLARIN repositories?</h3>
    <p>Yes, in particular the CLARIN Virtual language observatory
       or <a href="https://vlo.clarin.eu/">CLARIN VLO</a> for short.  This browser helps you find
       linguistic resources, services and tools provided by CLARIN as well as some other
       repositories.  However, please keep in mind that CLARIN VLO is an aggregator that provides
       information about a specific resource, but that the source repository, like CLARIN.SI
       typically gives more information, so it is worth checking also the source repository landing
       page, as given by CLARIN VLO. Original resources, services and tools are hosted by CLARIN
       centres and other data providers. This means that you cannot use the services and tools, or
       search and analyse the resources directly through CLARIN VLO.</p>
    <p>There are also other aggregators, such
    as <a href="https://explore.openaire.eu/search/">OpenAIRE</a>, which is a pan-European
    information platform and a network of Open Access repositories, or <a href =
    "https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100011922">re3data</a>, which is a global registry of
    research data repositories. The main difference between CLARIN VLO and OpenAIRE or re3data is
    that CARIN VLO focuses on the language resources, services and tools, whereas the other two
    cover all academic disciplines.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="CLARIN-or-GitHub">If I have my data or programs on GitHub, can I also deposit them on
    CLARIN.SI?</h3>
    <p>Yes, there are no constraints with regard to depositing GitHub data on the repository.  It
      is good practice to explicitly mention the commit hash that the repository data corresponds
      to.  For example, in <a href = "http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1236">this entry</a> the GitHub
      commit URL is stored as the &quot;Project URL&quot;, or you can mention the commit checksum
      in the description of the resource.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="CLARIN-or-ELRA">Why should I deposit my data with CLARIN.SI rather than with ELRA?</h3>
    <p>CLARIN and <a href="http://www.elra.info/en/">ELRA</a> both provide repositories for
      language resources but CLARIN always distributes the deposited resources for free and
      licences are typically CC while ELRA mostly uses a commercial model of resource distribution
      and offers appropriate licences for such use.  Also, the main target communities of CLARIN
      are those of the Humanities and Social Sciences, while ELRA is exclusively targeted at the
      Language Engineering community - which is not to say that CLARIN does not also provide many
      resources for Language Engineering as well.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="what-is-the-handle-good-for">What is the PID (handle) good for?</h3>
    <p>It is a special permanent URL. It provides a permanent link that will resolve correctly even
      if in some distant future the data is moved. Thus it should be used as URL in citations.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="what-is-deposit-procedure">What is the actual depositing/archiving procedure?</h3>
    <p>During the submission of digital language resources to the repository, the data undergoes a
      curation process in order to ensure quality and consistency. We assist you in meeting
      necessary requirements for sustainable resource archiving. Data has to be provided with
      metadata in standard formats accepted/adopted in the respective communities, persistent
      identifiers (PIDs) have to be assigned, IPR issues have to be resolved and clear statements
      with regard to licensing and possible use of the resources are to be made.  The depositor is
      also required to electronically sign a deposition agreement acknowledging that (s)he is the
      holder of rights to the data and that (s)he has the right to grant the rights contained in
      this licence.  Once the data is deposited in the repository, it is assigned a PID for stable
      reference. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="how-to-update">What if I want/need to update the archived data?</h3>
    <p>Every change to the resources and metadata should be stored as a new version with a new PID.
      However if the changes are minimal (e.g., typos or clear mistakes) then contact our
      <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> with the submission PID and the changes
      which should be made. It is up to the reviewer to decide whether these changes should result
      in a new version or not.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 id="new-version">How do I create a new version of a resource?</h3>

    <p>We do not allow changes in the data (except to fix obvious errors) after a submission was
    published. If a new version of a resource is created, you need to create a new submission,
    however, you do not (in fact, should not) create a new submission from scratch, but follow the
    following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in and go to the list of your existing Submissions. You can only create a new
      version from your previous submission, not from somebody else's – to do it yourself, you have
      to ask them to perform steps 1 – 3 in this list and Save & Share the entry with you, and then
      you will be able to finish it.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to Archived Submissions, tick the select box of the record you want to
	create a new version of, and select "Add new version".</li>
      <li>This creates a cloned record for you, just as if you created a new submission. This new
      submission has all the metadata from the previous one already copied. Click "Resume". Now you
      are in the submission workflow.</li>
      <li>Modify the metadata you want changed. You should at least modify the title by giving it
      a new version number, and, at the end of the description, briefly describe the differences to
      the previous version. If the size of the resource has changed, you should also modify the
      size information.</li>
      <li>Upload the data of the new version and finish the submission as usual.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the submission is finished, the old and new versions are automatically connected, so
    that the users can see that newer / older version(s) of the resource exists.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="how-to-delete">What if I want to withdraw the resources in the future? Can I delete the
    data?</h3>
    <p>Yes, in this case contact our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> with the
      submission PID and the reason.  However, we need to keep a reference that the data was in our
      repository (because a persistent identifier was issued), so the administrative metadata will
      be retained indicating that the data itself were removed.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="how-to-embargo">I don't want to/cannot make the data publicly available or want/can
      make them available only after a specific date. Could I still archive them with
      CLARIN.SI?</h3>
    <p>In accordance with the advocacy of the research infrastructures and the general development
      with respect to Open Access, we strongly encourage the data producers to be as open as
      possible.  However, in certain circumstances we will archive your data even if they will not
      be publicly available. Please, contact our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>
      prior to completing the submission.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="how-to-cite">How should I cite a submission?</h3>
    <p>See our <a href="./about">policies</a>.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="how-safe-is-my-data-if-i-store-it-with-you">How safe is my data, if I store it with
    CLARIN.SI?</h3>
    <p>Quite safe, probably much more than in your computer, because individual users, contrary to
      the CLARIN.SI infrastructure, usually do not have a sophisticated security and preservation
      plans and means for their implementation.  Uploading data to CLARIN.SI repository therefore
      has two main benefits: you can worry much less about unauthorised access to your data, and
      you do not have to think about backups. The final version of your data (that you submitted to
      the repository) is always there for you.</p>
    <p>Protection and preservation of data and software related to the repository is one of the
      priorities of the CLARIN.SI infrastructure.  For this reason, CLARIN.SI is hosted on
      dedicated infrastructure at the Jožef Stefan Institute providing highly available storage,
      backup and disaster recovery for archival data and software as well as high network
      security.</p>
    <p>Security and preservation requirements apply to the submitted datasets, their metadata, the
      exported backups and the complete software supporting the repository. Each of these
      components has its own data security and backup policy and implementation.  Virtual machine
      image backups, dataset backups and database export backups are cloned to the backup system of
      the Department of Knowledge Technologies at a different location to allow for full recovery
      in case of data centre failure.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 id="what-license-should-i-pick-for-my-datatool">What license should I pick for my
    data/tool?</h3>
    <p>We encourage using a free license. A representative selection of free licenses as well as CC
      licenses (more appropriate for data) is available directly during submission. There is a
      great <a href="./deposit#license_selector">OPEN License Selector</a> which can guide you
      through the selection of appropriate license.<BR/>  If for some reason you need a different
      license, please <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">contact us</a>.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="list-of-licenses">Where can I find more information about supported licenses?</h3>
    <p>The list of licenses currently supported is <a href="licenses" id="available-licenses">here.</a>
      However, do not hesitate to <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">contact us</a>
      in case you need a specific license. The licenses can be accompanied by various requirements;
      e.g., limited to logged-in users, filling additional details (purpose), etc.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="real-authors">Why CLARIN.SI strongly prefers real authors to institutions?</h3>
    <p>It is not about contact, it is about citations, credit and trust. That is why we have
      separate metadata fields for authors and for contact person. Contact to a helpdesk is
      perfect, not acknowledging the authors of a scholarly work is not. We support
      the <a href="https://www.force11.org/datacitation">direct citation of data</a>.  This is why
      we give PIDs, create formatted citations, etc. This is also the reason why we really want
      real authors, so that they get citations and other scientists know whose work they rely
      on.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3 id="searching">How do I get the most out of my searches?</h3>
    <p>In contrast to other search engines the CLARIN.SI repository one uses OR as a default
      operator; see examples below that clarify this. If you are not satisfied with the results of
      your searches, you might wish to go beyond plain text searches.  You may search only in
      certain fields, use negation, add score (emphasis) to some parts of the query.  The search
      engine is SOLR, so use its syntax if you know it or check
      <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Standard+Query+Parser">the documentation</a>.</p>
      <h4>Examples:</h4>
      <p>

	  <dt><a href="../discover?query=Slovenian+lexicon">Slovenian lexicon</a> vs <a href="../discover?query=Slovenian+AND+lexicon">Slovenian AND lexicon</a></dt>
	  <dd>The default operator is OR; i.e., the first example searches for Slovenian OR lexicon
