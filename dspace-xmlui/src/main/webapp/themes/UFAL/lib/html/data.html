    <h2>CLARIN.SI guidelines for data submission</h2>
    <div id="intro">
      <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The CLARIN.SI
        repository does not accept entries without data (i.e. without
        the bitstreams attached to the entry) and this document gives
        guidelines on the structure of the deposited language
        resources, which formats are accepted by the CLARIN.SI
        repository, and what standards should be used as the
        annotation formats in the textual language resource files.</p>

    <div id="basics" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
      <h3>Basic aspects</h3>
      <div id="fileNames">
        <h4>Names of files and directories</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Filenames, as well as directory (folder)
          names, should contain only ASCII letters, digits, the hyphen ("-") and period (".")
          characters. They should not contain spaces, underscores, brackets, quotes, dollars,
          slashes, colons, or other punctuation characters (except hyphen and period), nor accented
          letters or other non-ASCII characters. <i>Note that it is allowed to use a mixture of upper
            and lower-case letters</i>. Examples of good filenames are "semcro.v1.zip",
          "ParlaMint-HR-S08.xml", "SuperGLUE-statistics.tsv".</p>
      </div>
      <div id="fileExtensions">
        <h4>File extensions</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Standard or commonly recognised file
          extensions should be used, such as ".txt", ".xml", ".jpg". If the authors would like to
          indicate that the file is in a standard encoding, or that an archive file contains files
          of a certain type, then double extensions can be used, e.g. "semcro.tei.xml" or
          "semcro.TEI.zip".</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">In the rest of this document, the
          preferred extensions are given next to the file types.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="fileCompression">
        <h4>File compression</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> Language resources, deposited in the
          repository, are often large and/or consist of a number of files. In such cases, the
          resource should be compressed and submitted as a single file. A complete directory should
          be compressed, and the name of the compressed file should be the same as the directory it
          unpacks in. For example, the file "semcro.zip" should unpack into the directory "semcro/"
          which then contains the files and possibly subdirectories. It is recommended that the
          directory also contains a README text file, which gives the title of the resource and its
          handle. This prevents Creative Commons resources from losing their origin. It is also
          recommended that hidden files (such as those created by Macs) are not included in the
          compressed file.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">CLARIN.SI prefers ZIP (.zip) files, but
          accepts also other container compression formats, such as compressed TAR (.tgz) or, for
          single files, GNU ZIP (.gz).</p>
      </div>
      <div id="bitstreams">
        <h4>Entries with more than one bitstream</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> The data that is part of a submission,
          can contain, in addition to the source data, also the data in derived formats,
          accompanying documentation, or the data split into several pieces. This last case makes
          sense for large submissions, as an individual file should not exceed (approximately) 5 GB. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> In such cases the data can be submitted
          as several (possibly compressed) files. Follow some existing examples from the CLARIN.SI
          repository with different reasons for having several bitstreams:

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="binary">
      <h3>Accepted binary formats</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">CLARIN.SI accepts data in standard and/or
        well-known open formats (see also the CLARIN ERIC
        document <a href='http://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/Standards%20for%20LRT-v6.pdf'>Standards
        for LRT</a>). As most of the submissions involve marked-up or otherwise structured (mostly)
        textual data, and the rules here are somewhat more complicated, this is covered in the next
        section. Here we give the other (binary) formats accepted by CLARIN.SI:
	<ul>
          <li><b>Compression and packaging:</b> GNU ZIP (.gz), ZIP (.zip), TAR (.tar), compressed
            TAR files (.tgz).</li>
          <li><b>Document files:</b> for typeset document files we accept PDF (.pdf), but only for
            accompanying documentation (published papers or reports on the dataset, annotation
            guidelines etc.), and not for the primary dataset itself â€“ an exception are facsimiles,
            which can be, in addition to image formats, submitted also as PDFs. </li>
          <li><b>Language models:</b> if annotation or other open source language analysis tools
            produce or use only binary language models, these are accepted into the repository,
            although we prefer text versions of the models.</li>
          <li><b>Audio files:</b> Wave (.wav), FLAC (.flac), AIFF (.aiff), MPEG 4 audio (.m4a), MP3
            (.mp3), RAW (.raw). <i>Note that we prefer audio files with lossless or no compression</i>.</li>
          <li><b>Image files:</b> TIFF (.tiff), GIF (.gif), JPEG (.jpg), PNG (.png), SVG (.svg).
            <i>Note that we prefer images with lossless or no compression</i>.</li>
          <li><b>Video files:</b> MPEG video (.mpg, .mpeg, .mp4), AVI (.avi), Motion JPEG 2000
            (.m2j).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">CLARIN.SI, as a rule, does not accept word
        processor or spreadsheet formats, such as <b>Microsoft Word</b> or <b>Excel</b> files nor
          <b>binary (compiled) programs</b>. We allow such data in special cases, which should be
        discussed in advance via the repository <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>.
        If Word or Excel files are then submitted, they should always be in their XML encoding (i.e.
        with .docx and .xlsx extensions); equivalent <b>OpenOffice</b> XML-based ODF formats are, of
        course, also ok.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="encodingFiles">
      <h3>Encoding of textual files</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">As most of the repository submissions
        involve files, which are essentially text files (including numeric data, source program
        files, XML files, etc.), we here explain how such files should be encoded in more
        detail.</p>
      <div id="character">
        <h4>Character encoding</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> CLARIN.SI accepts only <b>Unicode</b>
          files. We do not accept files with 8-bit encodings, such as ISO 8859 or Windows code
          pages. The Unicode files should be encoded in <b>UTF-8</b>, with exceptions being text
          files in non-Latin based scripts, such as Japanese, which can use UTF-16.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="programs">
        <h4>Programs</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">We accept <b>source code</b>, i.e.
          programs in any of the better known programming languages, such as Python (.py), Perl
          (.pl), R (.r), C (.c), XSLT (.xsl) etc. including data packaged for such programs.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="standardText">
        <h4>Standard text-based formats</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">We also accept text-based formats which
          are supported by various standards bodies so that documentation is openly available on the
          Web. Prominent examples are JSON (.json) and RDF/Turtle (.ttl) files, or XML, which is
          further discussed below.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="plainText">
        <h4>Plain text files</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">For <b>unstructured text</b> we accept
          plain text files (.txt). Trivial formatting, such as the fact that a line break indicates
          a new paragraph or that text in square brackets indicates a transcriber comment can also
          be included, as long as the conventions used are explained in a README file.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tabular">
        <h4>Tabular data</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">For <b>spreadsheet or database-like data
          </b>, we accept commonly used formats such as tab (.txt/.tsv/.tab) and comma (.txt/.csv)
          separated values. Except for well-known tabular formats, such as CoNLL-U (.connlu), the
          tabular files should contain a header row and the data should be accompanied with a README
          file, explaining the meaning of the columns.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">We also accept the so-called <b>vertical
            files</b> (.vert/.vrt), which are a mixture of tabular data and XML-like tags, and are
          used by CQP-based concordancers, i.e. the Corpus Query Workbench, (no)Sketch Engine and
          KonText. If vertical files are deposited, they should also be accompanied by their
          registry file. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="html">
        <h4>HTML documents</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">We do not accept HTML (.html/.htm)
          documents as primary data, however, they can be used for documenting the entry, e.g.
          containing the explanation of the structure of the data or its linguistic annotation. Such
          HTML documents should be valid according to some version of HTML (preferably XHTML) and
          self-sufficient, i.e. if CSS is used, it should be, preferably, embedded in the HTML
          file(s) or stored together with them.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="xml">
        <h4>XML documents</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">By far the most common format of
          submissions is XML (.xml), which allows for richly and hierarchically structured text
          data. CLARIN.SI accepts any valid XML documents, where:
	  <ul>
            <li>the schema, that is used to validate a document is well-known and publicly available
              from a stable location, which includes the documentation, e.g. RDF/XML (.rdf) or ELAN
              (.eaf); </li>
            <li>or the schema, including its documentation, is a part of the repository entry. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">We accept the schemas in any XML schema
          definition languages, i.e. DTD (.dtd), RelaxNG (.rng/.rnc) and W3C XML schema (.xsd), as
          well as Schematron (.xml)</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tei">
        <h4>TEI documents</h4>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The preferred XML encoding of CLARIN.SI
          repository entries is TEI (.tei/.xml), i.e. using the <a
            href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/P5/">Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines</a> for
          encoding structured language resources, such as language corpora, machine readable
          dictionaries, text-critical editions, etc.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">When the type of the deposited language
          resource is covered by any of the standard or best-practice customisations of the TEI,
          such as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/37338.html">ISO 24624:2016</a> for
          transcriptions of spoken language, <a
            href="https://dariah-eric.github.io/lexicalresources/pages/TEILex0/TEILex0.html">TEI
            Lex0</a> for dictionaries, or <a href="https://clarin-eric.github.io/parla-clarin/"
            >Parla-CLARIN</a> for encoding corpora of parliamentary debates, these schemas should be
          used in preference to using bespoke or generic TEI encodings</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">If the deposited TEI documents use only
          standard modules of the TEI, in particular, if they can be validated according to the
          <a href="https://github.com/clarinsi/TEI-schema">CLARIN.SI TEI schema</a>, then only the XML TEI files can be deposited. But for document
          encodings that incorporate any extensions to the TEI, the TEI ODD and generated XML
          schemas (in particular RelaxNG .rng and .rnc) and documentation in at least HTML should
          always accompany such TEI XML data.</p>
