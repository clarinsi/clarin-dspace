    <div>
      <h3 id="submitted-item">Submitted Item</h3>
      <p>After you <a href="deposit#screen7">deposit</a> a submission it will be inserted into a 
      pool of submitted items. The item is not publicly available and waits for an editor
      to approve (or reject) it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="edited-item">Edited Item</h3>
      <p>The task of the editor is to verify whether the submission meets our requirements in
      respect to metadata quality and completeness, bitstream consistency and IPR. The editor can
      return the submission to the data depositor describing the needed changes. This step is
      repeated until the editor approves the item. The approved item becomes a published item.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="published-item">Published Item</h3>
      <p>Every item as soon as it is created obtains a PID (persistent
      identifier) which should, once the item is published, be used
      for referencing and citing e.g.,
      <strong>http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1041</strong>. The CLARIN.SI repository will ensure
      that the PID (more precisely, we use http handle proxy of the PID) will be resolved into
      a working web page (even if the current server infrastructure changes or is moved to a
      new domain) describing your resource.</p>
      
      <p>Published items are available through our search interface, browsing mode. Metadata of
      all items are submitted to search engines and are available through OAI-PMH protocol
      (several institutes harvest our repository for item's metadata
      e.g., <a href="http://catalog.clarin.eu/vlo/">CLARIN VLO</a>). Bitstreams of public
      submissions (see <a href="#restricted-submissions">Restricted Submissions</a>) are also
      available through OAI-ORE protocol.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h3 id="deleting-item">Deleting a Published Item</h3>
      <p>Anybody can request deletion of published data (bitstreams) through
	  our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>. However, such requests will
	  be evaluated on case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to keep the metadata of published submissions available in case
	  there is no very good reason why to delete the metadata. The reason is that this
	  would be against the concept of PIDs (<strong>persistent</strong> identifiers).
	  All PIDs are available through
	<a href="http://www.clarin.si/repository/oai/openaire_data?verb=Identify">OAI-PMH</a>
      interface even if only to inform that the item has been deleted.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="modifying-item">Modifying a Published Item</h3>
      <p>We allow for minor edits of the submission (e.g., typos) through
	  our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>. We also allow certain
	  additions to the metadata or data, e.g. adding keywords, adding information on a
	  new publication about the submission or adding new bitstreams where the data is
	  derived from existing ones. Suggestions for such edits are also evaluated on
	case-by-case basis.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 id="newversion-item">Submitting a new version of an Item</h3>
      <p>If a new version of a resource was created, you need to create a new submission.
	However, you do not (in fact, should not) create a new submission from scratch, but
	follow the following procedure:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>Log in and go to the list of your existing Submissions. You can only create a new
	  version from your previous submission, not from somebody else's – to do it yourself, you have
	  to ask them to perform steps 1 – 3 in this list and Save &amp; Share the entry with you, and then
	  you will be able to finish it.</li>
	<li>Scroll down to Archived Submissions, tick the select box of the record you want to
	  create a new version of, and select "Add new version".</li>
	<li>This creates a cloned record for you, just as if you created a new submission. This new
	  submission has all the metadata from the previous one already copied. Click "Resume". Now you
	  are in the submission workflow.</li>
	<li>Modify the metadata you want changed. You should at least modify the title by giving it
	  a new version number, and, at the end of the description, briefly describe the differences to
	  the previous version. If the size of the resource has changed, you should also modify the
	  size information.</li>
	<li>Upload the data of the new version and finish the submission as usual.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once the submission is finished, the old and new versions are automatically connected, so
	that the users can see that newer / older version(s) of the resource exists.</p>
      <p>A more detailed description, together with screenshots is availble from the 
	<a href="https://github.com/ufal/clarin-dspace/wiki/New-Version-Guide">GitHub
	  CLARIN-DSPACE</a> site.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h3 id="restricted-submissions">Restricted Submissions</h3>
      <p>First of all, all metadata are always publicly available. We support open access
      submissions; however, we also support
      <strong>restrictive licences</strong> for bitstreams which require e-signing before
      downloading the bitstreams.  We keep track of these e-signatures in case there are IPR
      infringements.</p>
      
      <p><a href="licenses">See currently available licenses</a>
      or <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">ask us</a> to add a specific one.</p>
      
      <p>We also support putting embargo on bitstreams which means that the bitstreams become
      publicly available after specific dates.</p>
